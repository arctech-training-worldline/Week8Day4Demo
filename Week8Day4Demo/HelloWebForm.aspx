    <h1>Wishing for a holiday</h1>
    <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br />
        My class is on, for me to learn.<br />
        My friends I see, only online,<br />
        when before I could meet them, at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, watching the sunrise,<br />
        The chirping of birds, singing of the rolling tide.<br />
        Thinking of people, watching the sunset,<br />
        Why can’t I visit that land? I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br />
        Watching moving pictures of a distant land.<br />
        I strain my ears listening to my father talk,<br />
        wishing I was on a beach holding his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, dreaming of times,<br />
        when my parents would say.<br />
        Daughter my dear, are you ready,<br />
        to go on a jet plane for an exciting holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br />
        watching people from cities far away.<br />
        Writing down in my diary,<br />
        So I can go say hello to them, some day
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, listening to my parents<br />
        talking of holidays we have been.<br />
        Remembering the good old times,<br />
        with a big naughty grin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br />
        I dream of snow-clad mountains and stormy rivers.<br />
        Wearing warm clothing sometimes,<br />
        and other times, dress up like swimmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The time will come, when we,<br />
        Don’t have to be alone at home anymore.<br />
        We could go anywhere,<br />
        And walk among the waves on the seashore.
    </p>
    <p>
        The time will come, when we<br />
        Can return to school.<br />
        Meet our friends and<br />
        Play the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The time will come, when we<br />
        Will wait for school to end.<br />
        So holidays can begin,<br />
        And we could travel, and make a new friend.
    </p>
    <p>
        So take my message everyone, and<br />
        plan your holidays with a joyful cry.<br />
        The times will surely change,<br />
        And we will again spread our wings and fly.
    </p>
